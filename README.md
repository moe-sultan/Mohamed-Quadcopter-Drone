# Mohamed's Quadcopter Drone
### The Idea
This is a quadcopter drone project initially with **Auto-leveling** capabilities, and implementing things like **Altitude holding**, **GPS holding**, **Course locking**, and **Telemetry** capabilities down the line. 

### Backstory
This started out as an idea for a team project during the third year of my computer engineering degree but due to different issues including poor team commutation (_as we were all from different countries so there was a sort of language barrier_), it ended up barely flying. But I am planning to revive the project now, working on it part-time and seeing how many of the aforementioned features I can implement in the coming year.

### Current Status
"Add current progress, what I have finished, what I'm working on, and what I want to do next here"

### Future Goals/Research
"Add what I would like to work on next and related research and findings here"
